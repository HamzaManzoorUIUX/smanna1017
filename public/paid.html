    After a successful signup and payment, your server will take some time to deploy.
This is usually done in a couple of hours and you will be notified by email (check
your spam folder) with your TCAdmin login as soon as it's ready. The reason for this is
so that we can manually check the functionality of your server, to ensure that everything is working properly after deployment. In many instances, other services that automatically deploy these kinds of servers encounter errors that will render a server incorrectly configured or completely inoperable. To avoid such issues, we prefer to allowan experienced staff member to manually deploy your server and then check it's functionality. We have staffavailable around the clock, ready to deploy your server at anytime. Thank you very much for your understanding as it is our goal to provide our clients with the best possible service.
